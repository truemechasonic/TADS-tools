Scads2 should build on any platform which supports GHC 6.2 (i.e. Win32 or
Posix). GHC versions prior to 6.2 will almost work, except that showHex
will prepend "0x" to hexadecimal numbers, which uglifies the output a bit.

The Makefile also builds a utility called "decrypt-tads2" which decrypts
the text in a .gam file. The decrypted file is still playable. I used this
for debugging, but it's not clear that it's useful any more.
